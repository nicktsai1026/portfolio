Hello!! My name is Nick and I am a full-stack developer with 4+ years of experience in web development, including building responsive websites, mobile applications, and backend RESTful APIs in the industry. 

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new development techniques is important to me. I actively evaluate and upgrade my skills to stay up-to-date on web development.

I'm proficient with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, and JS frontend Frameworks like Polymer and React.
